# Dispertion calculator

<h3>DEMO: https://innprogress.github.io/dispersija/</h3
  
Input the X and P(X) values to fill table needed to calculate mathematical expectation and dispertion
  
## Formulas
### Mathematical expectation:

### Dispertion:
![dispertion](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=DX+%3D+%28x_1+-+EX%29%5E2+%2A+p_1+%2B++%28x_2+-+EX%29%5E2+%2A+p_2+%2B+%28x_3+-+EX%29%5E2+%2A+p_3)
  
## Usage
Adding data to table:
- Fill the X and P(X) inputs with desired data

Deleting data from table:
- Click on 'X' symbol on the wanted to delete value pair

## Tasks
- [ ] Make possible to enter fraction to the table
- [ ] Add parenthesis to negative numbers
- [ ] Make it easier to add new data to table, maybe refuse using inputs under the table, add them in table at the end
- [ ] Round off the numbers with many numbers after comma
